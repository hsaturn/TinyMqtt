Exemple of commands that can be sent via the serial monitor to tinymqtt-test

--------

set name value	set variable name to value (later replaced)
set name	if no value, then var is erased
set	view all vars
reserved keywords are forbidden


client a	starts a client (not connected no internal broker)
a.connect [server][port][alive]	connects the client, default port=1883
a.publish topic [payload]	send a topic with a payload
a.subscribe topic	subscribes to a topic
delete a	destroy the client

* note, if 'server' is a number, then it replaces the end of the local ip.
